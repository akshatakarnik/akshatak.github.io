						<h2><strong>Hardware Hacking</strong></h2>
						<p> <font size="4"> I was a part of the medical device innovation hackathon, organized by <a href="http://betic.in/">BETiC, IIT Bombay </a> as a contestant. With the team, comprising of our dudes <a href="">Dr. Nitish Sancheti</a>, <a href="">Yash Gupte</a> and <a href="">Dhruv Mishra</a> and I, we developed a kiosk friendly device for screening patients with Diebetic Neuropathy on the feet. The solution developed was interactive, labourfree and uses well proven methods for the screening. The patient, after the test is recomended on the course of action depending on the severity of his condition. </font></p>

					<h2><strong>Drawing Trippy Shapes on Matlab</strong></h2>
					<p><font size="4">I love gears. <a href="https://ninadhw.github.io/Why_I_love_gears.pdf">Here</a> is a small presentation about this. I have written simple, noob time-marching codes to draw trippy shapes on Matlab that simulate cycloid drawing machines (in particular, Joe Friedman's Cycloid Drawing Machine). I have written codes with increasing gear train complexity that create trippy shapes. Find the git repository <a href="https://github.com/ninadhw/Trippy-Shape-Drawing.git"> over here</a>. It is a work in progress, as I am now writing a code for John Edmark's Cycloid Drawing Machine, which, I'm finding pretty difficult.  </font></p>
